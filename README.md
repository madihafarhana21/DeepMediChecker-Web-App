This web app aims to help researchers/scholars/health professionals retrieve information about the type of Drug-Drug Interactions for easy management and help improve the early detection of DDIs as it takes work for researchers and healthcare professionals to review the reports on drug safety and the published articles on Drug-Drug Interactions. To also provide research article recommendations from the existing corpus for their study on the type of DDIs.
